        <p>
          The Dalhousie Undergraduate Philosophy Society (DUPS), is a constituent society of the Dalhousie Arts and Social Sciences Society and the representative undergraduate society for the <a href="https://www.dal.ca/faculty/arts/philosophy.html">Philosophy Department</a>. DUPS is also cross ratified with the <a href="https://ukings.ca">University of King's College</a>.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          DUPS aims to provide an accessible platform for students at all levels of philosophical training, to encounter and interrogate ideas in the tradition, both through lectures and argumentation. DUPS is suited for all students interested in philosophical themes and students from other disciplines are encouraged to take part in the co-operative philosophical project.

          Our bread-and-butter event is the "<a href="bagelTuesdays.html">Bagel Tuesday</a>". We'd love to have you, and your friends, drop by and listen to one of our professors speak on topics of special interest to them. Free food and coffee doesn't hurt.
